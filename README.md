# odin-recipes
Simple recipe website per this specification - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

## Motivation
Although I have some experience in web development, I want to follow a more formal course to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and gain insight to other people's development methodologies. This website is just the first step on this course, which I am pretty comfortable with. I aim to stretch myself later in the course by learning Ruby and furthering my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
