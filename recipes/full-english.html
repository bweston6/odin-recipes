		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This is a hearty English breakfast, common in the UK. This recipe is made up largely of ingredients that someone would have in their fridge/cooler, although for an authentic experience, purchasing English back bacon and English sausages would be preferable.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>4 raw sausages (English sausages to be authentic)</li>
			<li>4 slices of bacon (English back bacon to be authentic)</li>
			<li>2 eggs</li>
			<li>half a tin (200g) of baked beans</li>
			<li>2 slices of bread</li>
			<li>1 large tomato</li>
			<li>half a cup (120g) of button mushrooms</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Method</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat your oven to 250°c or 480°F.</li>
			<li>Prepare you mushrooms by cutting off the ends of the woody stems, and washing them in a colander.</li>
			<li>Prepare your tomato by cutting off the stem, and slicing it in half.</li>
			<li>Crack your eggs into a bowl and whisk them until homogeneous.</li>
			<li>Place your sausages onto a oven tray, and begin cooking them for 15 minutes.</li>
			<li>Place your bacon into a cold pan and begin to cook on high.</li>
			<li>Once the bacon is crispy on one side, flip and begin browning on the other.</li>
			<li>When cooked, place the bacon onto a plate with paper towels to drain.</li>
			<li>If fifteen minutes have passed at this point, take the sausages out of the oven and flip them to get colour on the other side,</li>
			<li>Set your pan to medium, and scramble the whisked eggs in the same pan,</li>
			<li>Once the egg’s curd has set somewhat, push the eggs to the side of the pan and place your tomato into it (cut side down); building colour,</li>
			<li>Add your mushrooms to the same pan.</li>
			<li>Add your baked beans to a pot set to medium. Once they are simmering, they are done.</li>
			<li>Toast your bread as preferred.</li>
			<li>If half an hour has passed at this point, take your sausages out of the oven.</li>
			<li>Plate up by taking each ingredient and giving it its own portion on the plate.</li>
		</ol>
